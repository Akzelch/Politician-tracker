# Politician-tracker
Python application to scrape data of American congressmen/womens' trades.
So far the program is very barebones and simply scrapes capitoltrades extracting trade info and then filters it according to what politicians the user wants to track and the publish date of the trade.
The goal is to eventually plug into the alpaca API and make its own trades according to the tracked politicians.
